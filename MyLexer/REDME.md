Lexer or Lexical Analyzer - It is basically a splitter of string into tokens.
Parser - using grammer parser parses through tokens generated by lexer and creates a parse tree.
		 Parse tree consists of terminals and non terminal tokens.
         Parsers can optionally execute the expressio based on precedence and reduce the parse tree to a specific non terminal result.
